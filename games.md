# Interactive Experiences

Here are some interactive experiences, toys, and tools I've developed for a variety of purposes, from education to entertainment.

## Festival of Speed Future Lab X Euclid Space Telescope Explorer.

This web app allows you to explore the early Euclid imaging and we include in the Future Lab at the Festival of Speed 2025.

**Explore it [here](euclid_fos_viewer/index.html)**
