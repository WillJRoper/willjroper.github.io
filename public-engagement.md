# Public Engagement

I'm passionate about making cutting-edge astrophysics research accessible and engaging for everyone. I believe it is our duty to find the most engaging and innovative ways to communicate our research to the public, inspiring curiosity and fostering a deeper understanding of the Universe we inhabit. Below are some of the projects I've been involved in to bring astrophysics to a broader audience.

## Media Productions

### Our Universe (Netflix, 2022)

</p>

I contributed simulation data to the Netflix documentary series [Our Universe](https://www.netflix.com/title/81026629), narrated by Morgan Freeman. Working with [Lux Aeterna](https://luxaeterna.tv/), my cosmological simulations were used to create stunning CGI visualizations that bring the formation and evolution of galaxies to life for a global audience.

**Watch on Netflix:** [Our Universe](https://www.netflix.com/)

**Partner:** [Lux Aeterna](https://www.lavfx.com/)

## Extended Reality (XR) Experiences

### Cosmos in Focus

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ '/pictures/cosmos_in_focus.jpeg'  }}" alt="Cosmos in Focus XR Experience" width="60%">
</p>

An immersive XR experience developed in partnership with Atlantic Studios that takes users on a journey through the cosmos as seen by JWST. By combining real JWST data with the XR experience, users can explore distant galaxies, nebulae, and other celestial phenomena in stunning detail, gaining a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the Universe.

**Platform:** Apple Vision Pro
**Partner:** [Atlantic Studios](https://atlanticstudios.co.uk/work/)

### Cosmos Unseen: Black Holes

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ '/pictures/cosmos_unseen_bh.jpeg'  }}" alt="Cosmos Unseen: Black Holes XR Experience" width="60%">
</p>

An educational XR experience created for Galaxy XR that focuses on teaching the public about black holes in an intuitive and interactive way. Users can explore these mysterious objects from formation to their effects on surrounding space, making complex astrophysics concepts accessible through hands-on interaction.

[Available on the Google Play Store.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atlanticstudios.blackholes&hl=en)

## Museum & Exhibition Work

### Bluedot Festival 2019-2023

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ '/pictures/bluedot.jpeg'  }}" alt="JWST Exhibit at Bluedot Festival" width="60%">
</p>

For many years, I led a JWST exhibit at Jodrell Bank's Bluedot Festival, engaging thousands of visitors with the latest discoveries from the telescope. The exhibit featured interactive displays, expert talks, and hands-on activities that allowed attendees to learn about JWST's mission and its groundbreaking observations of the Universe.

**Years:** 2019-2023 (excluding 2020 due to the pandemic)
**Topic:** James Webb Space Telescope

### Festival of Speed (FOS) Future Lab

I've contributed to multiple exhibits at the Festival of Science Future Lab, helping to bring the latest astrophysical discoveries to the public. Each year the Future Lab attracts >100,000 visitors over the 4 days of the festival.

#### JWST Exhibit (2023)

<p align="center">

</p>

An exhibit showcasing the groundbreaking discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope. Visitors explored the telescope's capabilities and saw some of the first stunning images of the early Universe with experts on hand to explain the science behind the images. (In the image I am pictured explaining just how large the Universe is...)

**Year:** 2023
**Topic:** James Webb Space Telescope discoveries

#### Euclid and Cosmological Simulations (2025)

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ '/pictures/euclid_fos.jpeg'  }}" alt="Euclid at FOS" width="45%">
  <img src="{{ '/pictures/SuperSimulator.jpeg'  }}" alt="Interactive SWIFT simulation exhibit" width="45%">
</p>

A comprehensive exhibit demonstrating the Euclid space mission and state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. Visitors could explore how Euclid maps the dark Universe, become a gravitational lense to lens images with their own body, contribute to a citizen science project classifying galaxies, and interact with a large-scale SWIFT simulation running in real-time on a supercomputer.

**Year:** 2025
**Topics:** Euclid mission, cosmological simulations, dark Universe
