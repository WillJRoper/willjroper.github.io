# About Me

I am a Research Fellow at the University of Sussex. My work focuses on the development and analysis of cosmological simulations, with a focus on the first galaxies to form in the Universe. 
    
## Research

## Public engagement

In addition to research I'm an Outreach Development Officer at the University of Sussex. In this piosition I work to develop ways to communicate our research in exciting and (importantly) comprehensible ways.
